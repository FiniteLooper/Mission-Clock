Mission-Clock
=============

A clock for projection display - showing the average number of Christians martyered around the world in real time.

###Demo: http://chrismbarr.github.com/Mission-Clock/

This is inteded for projection on a screen, so your mouse cursor will be hidden!

Move your mouse to the bottom of the screen to make the controls visible.  You can start the timer from any number ou want, and eved add a delay.  It will also attempt to use Full Screen mode if your browser supports that.

This has not been tested in anything other than Google Chrome!
