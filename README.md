Mission-Clock
=============

 This is a counter that helps illustrate the point that 75 people whom have never heard the Gospel message will die each minute.
We got the number 75 as somewhat on an average. [This Site](http://www.biblehelp.org/signal.htm) says 103/minute, while [this one](http://strengthenedbygrace.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/how-many-people-die-daily-without-ever-hearing-the-gospel/) says a little under 50/minute

 This was built for a missions conference at my church & was displayed on a 720p projection screen.

###Demo: http://chrismbarr.github.com/Mission-Clock/

This is inteded for projection on a screen & a very specific purpose, so...

 - **your mouse cursor will be hidden!**
 - This is only designed to work on a 720p display
 - This has not been tested in anything other than Google Chrome!

Move your mouse to the bottom of the screen to make the controls visible.  You can start the timer from any number you want, and even add a delay.  There is also a button that will attempt to use Full Screen mode if your browser supports that.
